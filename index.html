        <h1 class="baloo">About us</h1>
        <p>
          The differences between academic content writing and other content writing (blog or website) are that, in the
          former one, there are many specific standards for writing. Moreover, in such writings, one has to follow
          different citation standards. In contrary to normal content writing, academic content writing has many
          regulations and an academic content writer has to follow certain formats. Just have a link with Best Content
          Solution and experience higher grades! We operate with trained professionals, who are well-aware of the art of
          paraphrasing as well as necessary referencing style to help you complete a plagiarism-free assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plagiarism can be defined as illegally taking an author's published work without properly giving credit. While
          preparing an educational assignment, you may take help from websites, journals and books available on the
          internet. However, your hard work may not be acknowledged in case the assessor finds plagiarism in it. In one
          hand, paraphrasing contents is a solution for avoiding plagiarism but on the other hand, a person may not know
          how to paraphrase effectively and fall into the trap of plagiarism.

              We take pride in our paper helpers that we can deliver all the client's requirements on time. However, if
              we miss any deadline, we allow the customers to request a 100% refund. And if you are ready to extend the
              deadline, we offer you a compensation of 20%. Also, if you come across any technical issues during
              payment, you can ask for a refund. In this case, you need to report the problem instantly before the
              assigned writer begins writing the task.

            <p>
              We allow you to raise a request for a refund of confirmed orders if the client has canceled the order.
              However, in such cases, we only give a 50% refund of the total amount. All the refund requests undergo a
              confirmation check before accepting the proposal. Rebates do not apply when the error was from the
              client's side, such as delayed uploading of needed documents and delayed payment. For refunds requested
              due to plagiarism, a Turnitin report should be available. Reports from other plagiarism checkers are not
              acceptable. Without the Turnitin report, no refund will apply.

              On time delivery of all the orders is guaranteed. Sometimes delay happens because of the late upload of
              the needed materials on the customer`s side. In this situation, NO REFUND CAN BE GRANTED. That is why it
              is always ideal to send the details of the task and the required additional resources all at once when
              making the initial order. Delayed Payment If the customer claims that the order has been delayed when the
              reality is that the payment was also delayed, we shall not bear responsibility for it. Moreover, a REFUND
              CANNOT BE REQUESTED. Note: in the case of revision deadline, the previously mentioned delay refunds and
              the recalculation of the price do not apply as the end dates are different.

              to be fully satisfied. Hence, we will always do our best just to achieve the customer`s satisfaction.
              Additionally, we don’t guarantee grades, and a REFUND WILL NOT BE PROVIDED if you were poorly assessed.
              But we might help you for next order. IMPORTANT NOTE: Refund requests must be made within 30 days from the
              date we submitted the paper. If requests are made after 30 days, a partial credit on the CheapestEssay
